# numba_bayesian_bins

Numba JIT implementation of [Bayesian Binning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24433966_Feature_extraction_from_spike_trains_with_Bayesian_binning_'Latency_is_where_the_signal_starts'#pf4).

A little slow compared to C++ implementation, but not unreasonable.

Used for latency and firing rate estimations in neural spike trains.
